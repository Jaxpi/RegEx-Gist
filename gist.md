# Title (replace with your title)

A regular expression - or RegEx - "is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern for text" (The Coding Train - 2.1: Introduction to Regular Expressions) and is used to find instances of non-specific character strings. One such RegEx is matching an email.

## Summary

A regex for matching an email ensures that the charcters entered by a user follow the format of a valid email address. I will explain the different components of this regex and how it is used.
This is an example of a regex for matching an email:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
